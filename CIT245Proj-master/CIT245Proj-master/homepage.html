<h2>Cloud Computing</h2>

<!--What-->
<a name="what"></a>
	<h1>What is it?</h1>
	<p>In the simplest terms, cloud computing is the process of storing and accessing data and programs
		over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive.</br>
		The cloud is just a metaphor for the Internet.
		</p>

<p>This means that instead of all the computer hardware and software you're using
sitting on your desktop, or somewhere inside your company's network, it's provided for you as a service
by another company and accessed over the Internet, usually in a completely seamless way.
</p>
<!--Who-->
<a name="who"></a>
	<h1>Who propagated and advanced cloud computing?</h1>
	<p>Cloud computing is believed to have been invented by Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider
		in the 1960s with his work on ARPANET to connect people and data from anywhere at any time.</p>
	<p align="center">

<p>In 1983, CompuServe offered its consumer users a
small amount of disk space that could be used to store any
files they chose to upload. The disk space typically allowed for 8k of memory,
which is roughly equivelent to 10 pages of text.</p>

<!--Services-->
<a name="services"></a>
<h1>What are the different cloud computing services?</h1>
<p>
IaaS: cloud-based services, pay-as-you-go for services such as storage, networking, and virtualization.
Some notable providers of IaaS include Amazon Web Services(AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Rackspace Open Cloud.
</p>

</iframe>
<p>
	PaaS: hardware and software tools available over the internet. Platform-based service is a category of cloud computing services that
provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure.
Some notable providers of PaaS include Oracle, Engine Yard, Open Shift, Microsoft Azure, and Google App Engine.
</p>
<p align="center">

</iframe>

<p> SaaS: software that’s available via a third-party over the internet. SaaS is closely related to the application service provider(ASP)
	and on demand computing software delivery models. The hosted application management model of SaaS is similar to ASP,
	where the provider hosts the customer’s software and delivers it to approved end users over the internet.
	Some notable providers of SaaS include Adobe, Salesforce, CA Technologies, and Intuit.</p>
	<p align="center">

</iframe>

<p>On-premise (also known as a hybrid cloud): software that’s installed in the same building as your business.
			 On-premise cloud infrastructure is a term related to cloud computing, which seems to contradict a
			 central principle of cloud services, namely, that cloud services are typically provided off-site as a fundamental part of
			 cloud technology design. On-premise cloud infrastructure would be hardware that is related to cloud services or activities,
			 that is located on-site at the client’s physical business location.
			 Some notable providers of on-premise hybrid clouds include VMware, IBM, Cisco, Microsoft, and Google.</p>

<!--COMPANIES-->
<a name="comps"></a>
	<h1>What companies were involved in the early iterations of cloud computing?</h1>
	<p>Cloud computing was popularized with Amazon releasing its Elastic Compute Cloud
		product in 2006. Elastic computing is a concept in cloud computing in which computing
		resources can be scaled up and down easily by the cloud service provider.
		Elastic computing is the ability of a cloud service provider to
		provision flexible computing power when and wherever required</p>
	<p>In April 2008, Google released the beta version of Google App Engine(GAE). App Engine offered
		automatic scaling for web applications—as the number of requests increases for an application,
		App Engine automatically allocated more resources for the web application to handle the additional demand.</p>
		<p align="center"> <iframe id="Companies" width="500" height="315"

		</iframe>
<p>In February 2010, Microsoft released Microsoft Azure, which was announced in
		October 2008. At its core, Azure is a public cloud computing platform—with solutions
		including </br>
		Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS)
		that can be used for services such as analytics, virtual computing, storage, and networking.</p>
	<p>In July 2010, Rackspace Hosting and NASA jointly launched an open-source
		cloud-software initiative known as OpenStack.</p>


<!--BENEFITS-->
<a name="benefits"></a>
<h1>What are the benefits to using cloud computing over traditional methods?</h1>
	<p>Agility for organizations may be improved, as cloud computing may increase users'
		flexibility with re-provisioning, adding, or expanding technological
		infrastructure resources.</p>

	<p>Device and location independence enable users to access systems using a web browser
			regardless of their location or what device they use (e.g., PC, mobile phone).
			As infrastructure is off-site (typically provided by a third-party)
			and accessed via the Internet, users can connect to it from anywhere.</p>
<p align="center"> <iframe width="500" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_e0B3Zxfx8">
</iframe>
	<p>Maintenance of cloud computing applications is easier, because they do not
		need to be installed on each user's computer and can be accessed from
		different locations.</p>
	<p>Reliability improves with the use of multiple redundant sites,
		which makes well-designed cloud computing suitable for business
		continuity and disaster recovery.</p>

<!--Future-->

<a name="future"></a>
<h1>Where is the cloud computing model headed?</h1>
	<p>A driving factor in the evolution of cloud computing has been
		chief technology officers seeking to minimize risk of internal outages
		and mitigate the complexity of housing network and computing hardware in-house.
		Major cloud technology companies invest billions of dollars per year in cloud
		Research and Development. For example, in 2011 Microsoft committed
		90 percent of its $9.6 billion R&D budget to its cloud.</p>
<p align="center"> <iframe width="500" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/isWYpdMGkpA">
</iframe>

<p>Major cloud technology companies invest billions of dollars per year in cloud
Research and Development. For example, in 2017 Amazon committed
$6 billion to its cloud R&D. That number increase to $22.6 billion in 2018.
The rapid expansion of resources dedicated to the development of cloud computing is on track to
continue to grow with analysts predicting Amazon's eclipse of the $100 billion mark in their cloud computing development by 2030.</p>
