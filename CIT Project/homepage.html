	<h1>What is it?</h1>
	<p>Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user</p>

	<h1>Who invented cloud computing?</h1>
	<p>Cloud computing is believed to have been invented by Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider in the 1960s with his work on ARPANET to connect people and data from anywhere at any time.</p>
	<h1>What companies were involved in the early iterations of cloud computing?</h1>
	<p>Cloud computing was popularized with Amazon releasing its Elastic Compute Cloud product in 2006</p>
	<p>In April 2008, Google released the beta version of Google App Engine</p>
	<p>In February 2010, Microsoft released Microsoft Azure, which was announced in October 2008</p>
	<p>In July 2010, Rackspace Hosting and NASA jointly launched an open-source cloud-software initiative known as OpenStack</p>
	<h1>What are the benefits to using cloud computing over traditional methods?</h1>
	<p>Agility for organizations may be improved, as cloud computing may increase users' flexibility with re-provisioning, adding, or expanding technological infrastructure resources </p>
	<p>Device and location independence enable users to access systems using a web browser regardless of their location or what device they use (e.g., PC, mobile phone). As infrastructure is off-site (typically provided by a third-party) and accessed via the Internet, users can connect to it from anywhere.</p>
	<p>Maintenance of cloud computing applications is easier, because they do not need to be installed on each user's computer and can be accessed from different places (e.g., different work locations, while travelling, etc.)</p>
	<p>Reliability improves with the use of multiple redundant sites, which makes well-designed cloud computing suitable for business continuity and disaster recovery</p>
	<h1>Where is the cloud computing model headed?</h1>
	<p>A driving factor in the evolution of cloud computing has been chief technology officers seeking to minimize risk of internal outages and mitigate the complexity of housing network and computing hardware in-house. Major cloud technology companies invest billions of dollars per year in cloud Research and Development. For example, in 2011 Microsoft committed 90 percent of its $9.6 billion R&D budget to its cloud.</p>
